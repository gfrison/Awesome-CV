      Software specialist and entrepreneur with a solid track record in the  design and implementation of systems
      used in banking, telecommunications, financial, e-commerce and social media networks.
      With a given domain and  goal to reach, I compare and contrast differing solutions and consistently I take
      initiative while honoring commitments. I have extensive expertise through current and past projects and I am up-and-ready
      to lead in a variety of contexts. My professional background lay mainly on JVM based systems but as could
      be noted on my track record, I comfortably contribute on all spectrum of aspects in the product development.
      What I excel is on the ability to define strategic visions, continuously evaluating how the goals fit with
      the overall success and providing customer valued software. My competences stretch also in the realm of machine learning,
      particularly on creating innovative and highly demanded conversational applications by mastering natural language
      processing algorithms.
