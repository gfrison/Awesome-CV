      Software specialist and entrepreneur with a solid track record in the  design and implementation of systems
      used in banking, telecommunications, financial, e-commerce and social media networks.
      With a given domain and  goal to reach, I compare and contrast differing solutions and consistently I take
      initiative while honoring commitments. I have extensive expertise through current and past projects and I am up-and-ready
      to lead in a variety of contexts. My professional background lay mainly on JVM based systems but as could
      be noted on my track record, I comfortably contribute on all spectrum of aspects in the software development.
      What I excel is on the ability to define strategic visions and continuously evaluate how the goals fit with
      the overall success. Looking for examples? Let's have a conversation.
